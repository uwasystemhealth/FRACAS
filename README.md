# FRACAS Team 1

## About

As part of the Master's in Information Technology Capstone unit (CITS5206), we are working with the University of Western Australia Motorsport club (UWAM) to develop a Failure, Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action System (FRACAS).  

The FRACAS for UWA Motorsport shall serve primarily as a means of recording and transferring knowledge of failures and what corrective actions were taken in response. Due to a lack of a comparable system, UWAM is seeking to eliminate the inefficiencies they are experiencing while transferring experience and technical knowledge to new members. This is exacerbated by the fact that UWAM is a student-led club, with members graduating and leaving the club every year.  

The FRACAS will be developed using the Agile methodology, with the project being broken down into 3 sprints. The first sprint will focus on developing a mock up  of the FRACAS Minimum Viable Product and refining specifications in regards to client's intentions. The second sprint entails creating a working prototype of the MVP. Lastly, the third sprint focuses on adding additional features and testing the system.  

The FRACAS will be implemented using the Django web framework, with the system being hosted on the AWS cloud platform. The system will be developed using the Python programming language, with the front-end being developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database. The application will be available to users via a web browser on a desktop computer or mobile device.  

## Features

* A user can create a new account
* A user can create a new failure report
* A user can view a list of all failure reports
* A user can search for a failure report
* A user can view a specific failure report
* A user can edit a failure report
* A team lead can do everything a user can do and:
* A team lead can assign users to a team
* A team lead can mark a failure report as resolved
* A team lead can view a list of all users
* A team lead can delete a failure report

## Project Background

The University of Western Australia Motorsport club (UWAM) is a student-led club that competes annually in the FSAE-Australasia student design competition. This competition involves designing, building and racing a formula-style racecar. UWAM is inefficient at transferring experience and technical knowledge from competent members such as current Team Leads to new members.  

This project aims to build and test a Failure, Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action System (FRACAS) for UWAM.  

This system will serve as an element of a greater knowledge management and transfer system, allowing current and future members to see records of past failures and how they were dealt with. Our intention is that this knowledge capture system can improve UWAM's scheduling, budgeting, management, vehicle testing, and the focus of future design efforts.  

A requirements documents has already been developed as part of a BPhil 2nd year project. The clients are Erwin Bauernschmitt from UWAM and Prof Melinda Hodkiewicz (a maintenance and reliability engineer). A copy of the requirements document is available here.
