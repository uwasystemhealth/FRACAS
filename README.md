# FRACAS Team 1 - Stanley Fluke, James Braunage, Sachin Thekkooden, Stanley Ser, Wenbo Gao, Yanchen Zhao 
FRACAS for UWA Motorsport

The University of Western Australia Motorsport club (UWAM) is a student-led club that competes annually in the FSAE-Australasia student design competition. This competition involves designing, building and racing a formula-style racecar. UWAM is inefficient at transferring experience and technical knowledge from competent members such as current Team Leads to new members.

This project aims to build and test a Failure, Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action System (FRACAS) for UWAM. 

This system will serve as an element of a greater knowledge management and transfer system, allowing current and future members to see records of past failures and how they were dealt with. Our intention is that this knowledge capture system can improve UWAM's scheduling, budgeting, management, vehicle testing, and the focus of future design efforts.

A requirements documents has already been developed as part of a BPhil 2nd year project. The clients are Erwin Bauernschmitt from UWAM and Prof Melinda Hodkiewicz (a maintenance and reliability engineer). A copy of the requirements document is available here.
